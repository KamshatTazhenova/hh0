Hierarchical Hubble Constant Inference

A more complete README is incoming, as is a more user-friendly interface. For now, note the following dependencies

 - [PyStan](https://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
 - [GetDist](http://getdist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)

and that the Planck chains can be downloaded from the [Planck Legacy Archive](http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/#cosmology) for comparison. Why not try the following?
```
python stan_cpl.py
python stan_cpl_sample_plots.py
```
